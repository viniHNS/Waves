## Name and background of the project

Waves is a personal project to help me learn more about ESP32 systems and electronics. For this project, i'm using the grove port to connect more devices like an HC-12 module, maybe a CC1101 (??), and a IR receiver.
The name waves comes from the idea of using the RF and IR waves.

## Project status

The project is in the early stages of development. The main goal is to have a working prototype by the end of the year.

## To do

  - [x] Receive IR signals
  - [ ] Store IR signals
  - [ ] Send IR signals

- RF (433Mhz)
  - [ ] Send RF signals
  - [ ] Store RF signals
  - [ ] Receive RF signals

- Misc
  - [ ] Add SD card read and write (for storing IR and RF signals)
  - [ ] Play a song in startup

## Hardware
  - M5Stack CardPuter
  - IR receiver module
  - HC-12 module (i'll buy it soon)
